    "## Data Patterns and Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "### SDQ Score Interpretation Examples:\n",
    "- A child with SDQ_SDQ_Hyperactivity = 8, SDQ_SDQ_Conduct_Problems = 5 likely shows significant ADHD symptoms\n",
    "- A child with SDQ_SDQ_Emotional_Problems = 7, SDQ_SDQ_Peer_Problems = 6 might be experiencing anxiety and social isolation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connectome Interpretation Examples:\n",
    "- Strong positive correlation (0.7) between frontal and parietal regions might indicate good executive function\n",
    "- Negative correlation (-0.4) between amygdala and prefrontal regions could indicate emotional regulation difficulties\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parenting and ADHD Connection:\n",
    "- High APQ_P_APQ_P_ID (20) combined with high SDQ_SDQ_Hyperactivity (9) might suggest inconsistent discipline contributing to ADHD symptoms\n",
    "- High APQ_P_APQ_P_PP (27) might be associated with better behavioral outcomes even in children with ADHD\n"
